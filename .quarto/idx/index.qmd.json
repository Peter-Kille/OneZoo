To design successful, innovative environmental prevention and control strategies, zoonotic drivers need to be understood through an integrated systems approach. Our students will build an in-depth understanding of the connectivity between key drivers of pathogen host shifts, spillover and onward transmission; exploring pathogen, environmental and human societal processes that can promote zoonotic disease and form the basis of integrated solutions. Our award-winning educators and experts in zoonotic diseases and environmental sciences, from Cardiff University, Aberystwyth University, Queen's University Belfast, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will work collectively, fostering creation of the CDT research community, and empowering students to develop their own training to acquire strong employability skills. This CDT offers an unprecedented level of diversity and transdisciplinarity. Our pool of \\>170 supervisors span disciplines from Anthropology to Zoology (A-Z), and offers both breadth and depth of knowledge in environmental, veterinary, biomedical, humanities and human clinical research to provide holistic training. Our diverse range of external partners (from NGOs to governmental bodies) will provide the students with real world knowledge to complement their academic training.\n\n# HOW MANY STUDENTSHIPS ARE AVAILABLE?\n\nUp to 20 studentships are available for October 2023. The NERC/BBSRC/MRC awarded 16 notional studentships to the CDT and the four academic institutions are contributing additional funds to uplift this number to 20. We anticipate similar numbers of students in Years two and three.\n\n# HOW DO I SUBMIT A PROJECT PROPOSAL?\n\nZoonoses project proposals must be submitted by Noon on Friday 28th February 2023 using the online survey:\n\nhttps://cardiff.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/onezoo-cdt-supervisor-project-proposals-2023 Once the application deadline has passed, a project selection panel comprised of at least one representative from each institution will first score then jointly scrutinise projects and select the top 40 for advertisement. You will be informed of the outcome of this process by the end of March.\n\nFor further guidance please read our FAQs document\n\nOur Partners:\n\n![](images/Stackholders.png)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/Funders.png)\n\nInterviews are currently ongoing\n\n# Student Applications are now Open for entry 2023\n\nFor all details of how to apply and more information see [student faqs](student_app.qmd), for available projects see [Project 2023](projects_2023.qmd).\n\n# Introduction to OneZoo CDT\n\nOur transdisciplinary OneZoo CDT will equip the next generation of world-leading scientists with the skills and insight necessary to tackle current and future zoonotic threats.
