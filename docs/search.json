    "text": "It is mandatory that students spend a part of their training (between three and eighteen months) with the CASE partner.\nUKRI studentships can be delivered in collaboration with non-academic partners from the private, public and third/civil sectors; where studentships are delivered in collaboration they are referred to as ‘CASE studentships’. CASE studentships provide the PhD students with enhanced training opportunities by ensuring they spend between three and eighteen months in total with their CASE partner in a workplace outside the academic environment. This placement represents an important contribution to the training of the student and should provide specific training or access to capabilities and expertise not available at the academic partner.\nCASE studentships provide outstanding students with access to training, facilities and expertise not available in an academic setting alone. The CASE partners benefit from self-motivated, highly capable PhD students undertaking cutting-edge research relevant to their organisation’s priorities and objectives. Both parties are also able to build and strengthen business and research collaborations. CASE studentship projects must provide sound training in research methods, and a stimulating intellectual challenge for the student. The work’s impetus and initial requirement should originate from the CASE partner. Both the research organisation and the CASE partner nominate supervisors responsible for overseeing the student’s training.\nImpact is one of the CASE scheme’s main criteria. Studentships should demonstrate the potential for societal or economic impact through collaboration with the CASE partner and the provision of high quality training in research skills.\nCASE partner responsibilities\nCASE partners are required to supplement the studentship, and thus enhance the research project, by:\n\npaying at least £1,000 per year to the lead research organisation to supplement the Research & Training Support Grant (RTSG) for the duration of the studentship\nin addition to the cash contribution above, meeting the extra expenses (such as travel and subsistence) incurred by the student visiting and working in the CASE establishment(s)\ncontributing in cash or in kind towards necessary materials whilst the student is based at the CASE partner establishment(s)."

Our students will build an in-depth understanding of the connectivity between key drivers of pathogen host shifts, spillover and onward transmission; exploring pathogen, environmental and human societal processes that can promote zoonotic disease and form the basis of integrated solutions.

Our diverse range of external partners (from NGOs to governmental bodies) will provide the students with real world knowledge to complement their academic training.\n\n\nHOW MANY STUDENTSHIPS ARE AVAILABLE?\nUp to 20 studentships are available for October 2023. The NERC/BBSRC/MRC awarded 16 notional studentships to the CDT and the four academic institutions are contributing additional funds to uplift this number to 20. We anticipate similar numbers of students in Years two and three.\n\n\nHOW DO I SUBMIT A PROJECT PROPOSAL?\nZoonoses project proposals must be submitted by Noon on 1st January 2024 using the online survey:\nCDT Applications 2024. Once the application deadline has passed, a project selection panel comprised of at least one representative from each institution will first score then jointly scrutinise projects and select the top 40 for advertisement. You will be informed of the outcome of this process by mid January.\nPreview of the form can be downloaded here: [].\nFor further guidance please read our FAQs document\nOur Partners:"

    "text": "What is the OneZoo Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT)?\nMore than 60% of current and emerging human infections have a zoonotic origin (i.e. they are transferred between animals and people) and zoonotic pandemics cost the global economy over $60 billion each year. Being able to predict, detect and control zoonoses represents one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity. Our transdisciplinary OneZoo CDT has been created to train postgraduate students in the skills that you will need to become the next generation of leading scientists capable of tackling current, emerging and future zoonotic threats.\n\n\nWhat will I do?\nAs a OneZoo student you will undertake a 3.5 year systematic programme of training in core transferable and specialist skills, alongside your specific PhD project, that will build an in depth understanding of the key drivers of zoonotic diseases and form the basis of integrated solutions. We will foster a global citizenship outlook so that you can improve the health and wellbeing of humans and animals in an environmentally sustainable manner that is equitable and cognisant of socioeconomic, political and cultural needs and constraints.\nYour chosen PhD project will be a core focus of your postgraduate journey, but you will also receive training in disease management through our zoonoses case studies which will explore viral (SARS-CoV-2), bacterial (Bovine Tuberculosis, BTB), protist (zoonotic malaria) and metazoan (fascioliasis. liver fluke) zoonotic diseases. These student-centred case studies will be hosted by our four core CDT partners, Cardiff University, Aberystwyth University, Queen’s University Belfast and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nYou will be trained in translational experimental design including quantitative and qualitative data analysis, bioinformatics and R statistics and modelling. You will also be trained in science communication and impact (including thesis writing) and public engagement.\nThroughout your OneZoo programme you will be supported through your Personal Development Plan which you will create with your multidisciplinary supervisory team (which includes external stakeholders such as industry, public health bodies and not-for-profit partner organisations) to identify your developmental and training needs for your specific project. In addition to your supervisory team, you will also be supported by the Research Culture and Wellbeing Lead and the OneZoo Management Board.\n\n\nPlacements\nIn addition to CASE studentships, all students will be offered placements during their PhD. These can be of short duration scattered throughout the PhD or occur in a block. For the latter, work conducted during the placement can either contribute directly to your PhD research or you may wish to take Interruption of Study (IOS) for a few months to gain insight into another aspect of One Health not directly related to your PhD project.\n\n\nIs this right for you?\nWe are looking for enthusiastic students who are willing to be challenged in the way that they approach research, receptive to transdisciplinary training, and flexible to adapt their projects following stakeholder engagement.\n\n\nHow do I apply for a OneZoo Project and OneZoo Funding?\nApplication deadline: 1st May 2023. Interviews end of May 2023.\n\nFind out more about the projects available for a September 2023 start on our OneZoo CDT web pages.\nOnce you have found a project that you are interested in (please see list below) you may wish to contact the primary supervisory for an informal chat to discuss your interests.\nComplete the OneZoo CDT application Form for an ‘Offer of Funding’.\nComplete the OneZoo Equal Opportunities Form.\nCreate a 2 page CV.\nMake a copy of your passport photo page.\nSend items 2-6 to the OneZoo application address: OneZoo@cardiff.ac.uk. Important, title of the email sent to OneZoo must include the name of the host institution to which you are applying and surname of the primary supervisor (e.g. “Cardiff_Cable”).\n\nIn addition, you must make a formal application for an ‘Offer of Study’ through standard channels to the institution of your selected first choice:\n\nCardiff (CU\nAberystwyth (AU)\nQueens University Belfast (QUB)\nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"
