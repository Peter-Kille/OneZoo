# What is the OneZoo Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT)?

More than 60% of current and emerging human infections have a zoonotic origin (i.e. they are transferred between animals and people) and zoonotic pandemics cost the global economy over \$60 billion each year. Being able to predict, detect and control zoonoses represents one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity. Our transdisciplinary OneZoo CDT has been created to train postgraduate students in the skills that you will need to become the next generation of leading scientists capable of tackling current, emerging and future zoonotic threats.

# What will I do?

As a OneZoo student you will undertake a 3.5 year systematic programme of training in core transferable and specialist skills, alongside your specific PhD project, that will build an in depth understanding of the key drivers of zoonotic diseases and form the basis of integrated solutions. We will foster a global citizenship outlook so that you can improve the health and wellbeing of humans and animals in an environmentally sustainable manner that is equitable and cognisant of socioeconomic, political and cultural needs and constraints.

Your chosen PhD project will be a core focus of your postgraduate journey, but you will also receive training in disease management through our zoonoses case studies which will explore viral (SARS-CoV-2), bacterial (Bovine Tuberculosis, BTB), protist (zoonotic malaria) and metazoan (fascioliasis. liver fluke) zoonotic diseases. These student-centred case studies will be hosted by our four core CDT partners, Cardiff University, Aberystwyth University, Queen's University Belfast and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

You will be trained in translational experimental design including quantitative and qualitative data analysis, bioinformatics and R statistics and modelling. You will also be trained in science communication and impact (including thesis writing) and public engagement.

Throughout your OneZoo programme you will be supported through your Personal Development Plan which you will create with your multidisciplinary supervisory team (which includes external stakeholders such as industry, public health bodies and not-for-profit partner organisations) to identify your developmental and training needs for your specific project. In addition to your supervisory team, you will also be supported by the Research Culture and Wellbeing Lead and the OneZoo Management Board.

# Placements

In addition to CASE studentships, all students will be offered placements during their PhD. These can be of short duration scattered throughout the PhD or occur in a block. For the latter, work conducted during the placement can either contribute directly to your PhD research or you may wish to take Interruption of Study (IOS) for a few months to gain insight into another aspect of One Health not directly related to your PhD project.

# Is this right for you?

We are looking for enthusiastic students who are willing to be challenged in the way that they approach research, receptive to transdisciplinary training, and flexible to adapt their projects following stakeholder engagement.
